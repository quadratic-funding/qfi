      "Goal: Publish a book that provides information, wisdom and insights into Impact DAOs. The practical guidebook would show changemakers how Impact DAOs operate and execute on their mission. Why study Impact DAOs: Impact DAOs have exploded in the last 9-12 months. Web3 entities like Gitcoin has moved to a DAO model, traditional nonprofits like Big Green are experimenting with DAOs and the new ones are launching DAO first to govern their platform and other offerings. We believe in the near future DAOs will become the most natural way to organize around causes. It's therefore important to equip the web3 changemakers with good documentation. How we plan to do it: This is a distributed collaborative project. We put out a call for collaborators and have attracted global talent working at the intersection of web3 x media x social impact. We plan to study 10 Impact DAOs in-depth through conversations with founders and contributors. We plan to include an equal mix of social impact and climate DAOs. Over the course of the study we plan to continuously share information as we study the DAOs. Our end goal is to publish an open source digital book that serves as a definitive guidebook to web3 changemakers. Scope of the study: The research would involve interviewing founders and members to understand the DAO motivation, structure, tokenomics, governance, funding, tooling, deliverables and impact measurement criteria. We estimate a timeframe of about 2 months to study 10 Impact DAOs in social and climate categories. Who are we? We are a women led, men supported global team spanning age, gender, race and culture. A collective of folks working at the intersection of web3 + impact + media. Our team includes writers, podcasters, researchers, published authors, social entrepreneurs, climate activists, web3 developers, designers and Dream DAO Gen Z members from across the world. Some of our team members on Twitter are @crystaldstreet, @deeparocks, @karanth_harsha, @tranimal, @katerinabohlec, @actThreeCC, 0xSardius, @Value_Strat @zaldarren.

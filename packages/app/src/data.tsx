Faster development times in python allows for faster iteration speeds An interactive console allows you to debug where your test failed Down the line, we also plan to implement: - Woke comment - adds comments to the codebase such as where a specific function is used - Woke read - takes the codebase contents and creates an html file - Woke debug - a line-by-line (not instruction-by-instruction) Solidity debugger for any chain / framework, including Hardhat and Foundry.

Thanks to cooperation with established non-profit organizations, we can offer NFTs that represent particular living sea turtles in the real world. So, unlike most mainstream NFT projects, we connect the virtual world with reality. How does it work? Each turtle has a unique facial scale pattern that is akin to a human fingerprint. With the use of multiple computer-assisted algorithms which are comparable to human facial recognition programs, we can identify and track the progress of the ID turtles. Once entered into the identification program we can then digitize and convert each individual turtle in the database into an NFT.",

Paralelní Polis didn't have time to figure out whether Bordel brings the order or just another separatist movement. Being part of Polis, Bordel lives its own life but in the deepest symbiosis possible. That's why we troll Polis folks and compete in the vote for funding. Bordel pays its fair share within Paralelní Polis and creates a lot of its own content and expensive tools for the community. Bordel’s archival node is also one of the projects you support by voting for us. TLDR, vote for us and come have a party in Bordel!",

      "Bordel is nothing which can be explained by words. It's an experience, daily and trip long experience which has to be integrated by your own mind. Come to have a party to Bordel during EthPrague! All the hackers are invited.* The party in our underground shady semi-legit-almost-a-bar Bordel is opened for you every night till 4:20AM. Don't hesitate to pay a visit. *We are sorry but please don't visit us if you have epilepsy or in case you are a cop",

      "The local community around Octopus Lab is active in many ways. The physical hackerspace lab in Prague 10 has been developing, building, educating in free and open source software and hardware for more than 10 years. It provides a huge variety of tools, materials to build and generally hack hardware, various electronics and software systems. Since the beginning, the community was inspired by the revolution of virtual reality and cryptocurrencies and built hardware focused on adopting the new technology. ATMs, point of sale terminals, NFC payments for Bitcoin and other currencies were already built here 7 years ago. Apart from that, the community was building tools, researching and educating about electronics, virtual and augmented reality, internet of things, 3D printing liberation, cracking private keys and entropy, Python ecosystem, machine learning and much more. Workshops and educational content are also part of the mission. All of the previous work is open and it's hard to sum up all the projects. To mention some current initiatives: - ČUDO - crypto universal device, created at Flying Circuit hackaton in Paralelní Polis. It includes libraries for receiving via PoS system, serving as ATM and communicating with payment cards. - LNATM - Lightning ATM which enables smooth onboarding experience via anonymous p2p trade. Started as an open python re-implementation of Bleskomat ATM, LNATM includes security features and NFC card option in a simple design. - Agama Point - research community focused especially on cryptocurrencies, entropy and chaos, cryptography in Bitcoin and exploring new possibilities of these technologies. One of the original goals, long before metaverse buzzwords, was to create an universal platform connecting Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Internet of Things, which  allows users to create, visualize and manage data, and have fun cooperating in a virtual space without boundaries. Projects involving cryptocurrencies and AI are here to help us build a parallel and sustainable collaborations built on free and open technologies. ",

The project aims to build on existing work by the go-ethereum and devOps teams from the Ethereum Foundation.
